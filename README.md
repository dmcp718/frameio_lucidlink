# frameio_lucidlink webhook app

This app configures a host system to create an ngrok tunnel and frame.io webhook listener. As the app receives webhooks from frame.io, the app initiates a download of the asset from frame.io to the designated LucidLink Filespace directory.

To setup the app on a host system for the first time, double-click this file:

```
setup_script.command
```

Once the initial setup completes, double-click this file:

```
run_app.command
```
